WHY POGGLE DOES NOT NEED POTENCY

- Geo Soldier applies Tenacity Down (un-resistable) on on basic.

- Tenacity Down reduces the target's tenacity to the minimum base value (15%)

- This means that there is ALWAYS a baseline 15% chance for Poggle's Ability Block to be resisted

- Poggle's Ability Block has a flat 80% chance to be applied. This is built into the Ability

- This means there is an 80% chance AB will be applied, and a 15% chance it will be resisted

- 0.80 * 0.85 = 0.68

- This means that, against an enemy with Tenacity Down, there is a 68% chance that AB will land.

- THIS CANNOT BE MODIFIED BY TENACITY OR POTENCY.

- Stop putting Potency on Poggle please.
